# Vault RBAC — Policy Templates (PLACEHOLDER PATHS)

This repository contains draft RBAC policies for humans and machine roles.
Story 0.2.1 (Path Structure) is pending, so all policies use placeholder paths:

    secret/data/<env>/<team>/<service>/*

Once Story 0.2.1 finalizes the structure, paths will be updated and tested.

Contents:
- RBAC Matrix
- Policy HCL Files
